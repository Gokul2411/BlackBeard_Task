# BlackBeard_Task

The code contains reading, visualizing and fast fourier tranfrom along with band pass filter for a given signal in .edf format.

# Conditions followed
The .edf file contained seven signals out of which the code uses the 0th indexed signal and the total number of values in the zeroth index was 78500 but the code uses the first 1000 values for vusualizing, fast fourier transform and filtering. This is to show a better image of signal represtation and signal processing.

Regarding the DeepSleepNet model to infer sleep stages on the given sample data, since the required python version is 3.5.4 and the one in my pc is 3.9, i was unable to run the train file in the given time. The tenserflow version for python 3.9 is different from 3.4.5 and was required to change the entire code, so i was unable to proceed

Thank You!
